// let character = "Hello";
// let count = 8;
// let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
// console.log(rows[0]);

// arrays are mutable, you can change the value at index directly

// rows[2] = 10;
// console.log(rows);

// mutation = change

// array.length returns number of elems in array. by subtracting 1, you get index of last element in array. 

// rows[rows.length - 1] = 10;

// let cities = ["London", "New York", "Mumbai"];
// cities[cities.length - 1] = "Mexico City";


// console.log(cities);

// method in js is a function that's associated with certain values or objects

// .log() is a method of the console object

// arrays have methods. push method allows pushing a value to the end of the array. 

// rows.push("freeCodeCamp");

// pop method removes last element from array and returns the element

// let popped = rows.pop();
// console.log(popped);

// let pushed = rows.push("freeCodeCamp");
// console.log(pushed);

//  push returns the new length of the array, after adding the new value, not the actual value added

// declaring with let keyword allows it to be reassigned so you can change a value later on. 

// const variables cannot be reassigned like let variable. it also cannot be uninitialized whereas let can. 

const character = "#";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];

// when you have to perform a task repeatedly until a condition is met, you use a loop. for loop:

// for (iterator; condition; iteration) {
// logic;
// }

// the iterator is a variable you can declare specifically in for loop to control how the loop iterates or goes through your logic

// Assign it the value 0 to start. This will give the i variable the value 0 the first time your loop runs.

// for (let i = 0; ) {

// }

// condition of loop tells loop how many times to iterate. when the condition becomes false, the loop stops



// for (let i = 0; i < count; ) {

// }
